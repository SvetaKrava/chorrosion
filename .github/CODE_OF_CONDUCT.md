# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact the project team at: repo-maintainers@local (replace with an appropriate contact email).

All reports will be handled with discretion and with respect to the privacy of all involved.

## Enforcement Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. The maintainers will review and respond to all reports in a timely manner.

Consequences for unacceptable behavior may include temporary or permanent bans from the project, removal of privileges, or other actions deemed appropriate by project maintainers.
